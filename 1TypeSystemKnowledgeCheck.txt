4s. uint, since it doesn't need to allocate a bit for negative sign, all 32 bits are available to represent the value. This allows the uint type to store numbers in range of 0 to 4 billion.

6s. double. 
The reason why "double" can hold the largest numbers in C# compared to "float" and "decimal" is primarily due to the difference in the number of bits allocated to represent the value. With 64 bits, "double" can provide a larger range and accommodate more significant digits, allowing it to represent larger numbers accurately.
